;; Make M-p and M-n work as god intended, which is that if you type a prefix

;; rather than just throwing out what you typed and giving you the most
;; recent prior command.  For example:
;;
;;   % TRACE=pexpect/0-4,CliTest/0-4 make check TESTS=test/ReloadTest.py
;;   ... lots of output
;;   % echo hello
;;   % echo lots of other stuff
;;   % make all
;;   % rm /tmp/junkfile
;;   % TR<M-p>
;;
;; When you press M-p in the last line above, instead of recalling the
;; most recent command (the rm command), comint will recall the TRACE=...
;; command.  This is very handy.  -kduda 2009-02-12
